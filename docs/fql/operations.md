# High-level operations

The following high-level operations are described here after:

- [FOR]("operations/for.md"): Iterate over all elements of an array or an object.
- [RETURN]("operations/return.md"): Produce the result of a query.
- [FILTER]("operations/filter.md"): Restrict the results to elements that match arbitrary logical conditions.
- [SORT]("operations/sort.md"): Force a sort of the array of already produced intermediate results.
- [LIMIT]("operations/limit.md"): Reduce the number of elements in the result to at most the specified number, optionally skip elements (pagination).
- [LET]("operations/let.md"): Assign an arbitrary value to a variable.
- [COLLECT]("operations/collect.md"): Group an array by one or multiple group criteria. Can also count and aggregate.
